&lt;h2&gt;Your New Year's Resolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year! As we embark on another year, it's a great time to set new goals and resolutions for ourselves. If one of your goals for this year is to improve your language skills, we have a suggestion for you: make a resolution to spend more time practicing with language partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to do this is by purchasing a premium membership with Amikumu. With a premium membership, you'll have access to advanced features that make it easier to connect with language partners in your area. You'll be able to teleport to foreign locations, privately use the app while staying invisible to others and never experience another ad!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only will practicing with a language partner help you improve your skills, it's also a great way to meet new people and learn about different cultures. So why wait? Take the first step towards achieving your language learning goals by purchasing a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://app.amikumu.com/get_gold"&gt;gold membership&lt;/a&gt;  with Amikumu today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy language learning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amikumu team&lt;/p&gt;
