&lt;h2&gt;Your New Year's Resolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year! As we embark on another year, it's a great time to set new goals and resolutions for ourselves. If one of your goals for this year is to improve your language skills, we have a suggestion for you: make a resolution to spend more time practicing with language partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to do this is by purchasing a premium membership with Amikumu. With a premium membership, you'll have access to advanced features that make it easier to connect with language partners in your area. You'll be able to teleport to foreign locations, privately use the app while staying invisible to others and never experience another ad!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only will practicing with a language partner help you improve your skills, it's also a great way to meet new people and learn about different cultures. So why wait? Take the first step towards achieving your language learning goals by purchasing a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://app.amikumu.com/get_gold"&gt;gold membership&lt;/a&gt;  with Amikumu today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy language learning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amikumu team&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months the Amikumu team has worked hard to update and improve not only the app itself, but also the website, as well as several server-side improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the team got together for an actual live meeting, for the first time in years. A lot of progress was made and many ideas were shared and explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major changes we've made is the move from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://crowdin.com"&gt;CrowdIn&lt;/a&gt; to our self-hosted translation system on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://traduk.amikumu.com"&gt;http://traduk.amikumu.com&lt;/a&gt;. We chose &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://weblate.org/"&gt;Weblate&lt;/a&gt;, because this offers us the best option, for not only ease of use, but also for the number of languages we want to translate into. A lot of the tools out there will let us translate a limited amount of languages (for free), which doesn't fit our use-case, or they require us to pay a lot of money to have our desired languages. We strive to include all languages, and found that the best way to do that, is to host the translation system ourselves. Any language that does not yet exist in our system, can be added, so feel free to reach out to us if you miss one!&lt;/p&gt;
