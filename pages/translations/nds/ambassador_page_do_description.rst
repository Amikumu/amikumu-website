It depends on what they can commit. We've listed some of the ways our ambassadors are working with us to promote Amikumu around the world.

- They're publishing blog posts and YouTube videos! For example, check out `Amikumu: The App Yiddish Speakers have been Waiting for! <https://youtu.be/6g3QtBtBB_U>`__ (Moshe Sherizen) and `Auslan: What is Amikumu? <https://youtu.be/57W73If51NE>`__ (Kiah Morante) among others. We have an entire page dedicated to `press releases <http://amikumu.com/press/>`__.
- They're posting links in Facebook groups and on their profiles. Even a simple show of public support can go a long way!
- They're handing out flyers and talking about Amikumu in local language meetups. This is also a great way to establish and grow a local community.
- They're `translating the app <https://traduk.amikumu.com/projects/amikumu/>`__ and website to their local languages. Our goal is to become the most translated app in the world and we need all the help to achieve this.
- They're providing vitally important guidance. We understand that every language and culture is different. We want and need your advise on how to best act in your community.
