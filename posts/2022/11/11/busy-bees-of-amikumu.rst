Over the past few months the Amikumu team has worked hard to update and improve not only the app itself, but also the website, as well as several server-side improvements.

Most of the team got together for an actual live meeting, for the first time in years. A lot of progress was made and many ideas were shared and explored.

One of the major changes we've made is the move from `CrowdIn <https://crowdin.com>`_ to our self-hosted translation system on http://traduk.amikumu.com. We chose `Weblate <https://weblate.org/>`_, because this offers us the best option, for not only ease of use, but also for the number of languages we want to translate into. A lot of the tools out there will let us translate a limited amount of languages (for free), which doesn't fit our use-case, or they require us to pay a lot of money to have our desired languages. We strive to include all languages, and found that the best way to do that, is to host the translation system ourselves. Any language that does not yet exist in our system, can be added, so feel free to reach out to us if you miss one!
