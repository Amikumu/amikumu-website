#. The App allows Users to submit biographical information, profile photos, location data, and other communications (collectively, the **User Submissions**). The User Submissions may be hosted, shared, and/or published as part of the App, and may be visible to other Users who are within certain radial distance of your geo-location and which you have not expressly blocked. Direct messages, notifications and invitations that you send directly to other Users (collectively **Private Messages**) will only be viewable by those User(s) you directly send such Private Messages; but User Submissions may be globally viewed by other Users within certain distance from your geo-location, unless the User is blocked by you.
 	
#. By submitting the User Submissions to the App, you hereby grant Amikumu a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the User Submissions in connection with the App and Amikumu business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the App (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each recipient of your User Submission a non-exclusive licence to access your User Submissions through the App. The foregoing licence granted by you for each User Submission terminates once you remove or delete such User Submission from the App.
