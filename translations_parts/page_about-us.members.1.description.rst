Chuck Smith is the co-organizer of the Polyglot Gathering, contributor of Duolingo’s Esperanto course and founder of the Esperanto Wikipedia, among other Esperanto and polyglot projects. He has been developing iOS apps since Apple’s App Store launched in 2008. He had the idea for a GPS device to find fellow Esperanto speakers while traveling through Brazil in 2002, but needed to wait 15 years for technology to catch up, so he could pursue this dream. Now he looks forward to meeting the challenges ahead to help people everywhere connect to make the world a better place.
