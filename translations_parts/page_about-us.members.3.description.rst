Judith Meyer is a computational linguist spending most of her time developing web applications that deal with languages, such as her project LearnYu. She is also a polyglot, co-organizer of the Polyglot Gathering and author of many language books and language courses. She learned Esperanto when she was 14 years old so as to use it as a springboard to learning many other languages.
